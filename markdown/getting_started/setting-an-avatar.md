This article will show you how to add an avatar to your WebProfiles account.

## Setting your avatar

Once logged in, go to **"Dashboard" => "Account Settings" => "Change Avatar"**. 
Now, click "Select Avatar" and choose the image you would like to set as your avatar. Note that WebProfiles only accepts **PNGs and JPEGs/JPGs** under **3 megabytes**.
After you select the avatar you'd like to use, the site will automattically upload your avatar.
