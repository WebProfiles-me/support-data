Hello and welcome! This article is to help you get to know WebProfiles and how to work the website. If you don't already know what WebProfiles is, it is a new social website where you can link services such as YouTube and Spotify to verify that you own an account!

## Creating your Account

**Step One:** Go to the **[WebProfiles](https://webprofiles.me)** home page.\
**Step Two:** Click the "Register" button at the top-right of your screen **or** click [here](https://webprofiles.me/register) **or** on the home page, enter your email address then click sign up.

Well, that was easy! Your account setup is complete :) You should be on the discover page, you probably won't see any profiles since you have not selected any interests in settings yet. Interests are a way to show users what you are interested in! They also show other users who have the same interests.

## Setting up your Profile

Now it is time to set up your own profile! This may seem scary at first to some, but don't worry, it's easy as 123.

**Step One:** Click on the dashboard button on the top-right. You should be taken to something that looks similar to the image below:

**Step Two:** Click on any of the services shown, login to it, and view the linked account on your WebProfile profile. Once you have added all of your services, you can either click on the "Account Settings" options and edit your interests or change/reset your email or password, **or** you can click on your username to view your profile which should look like the image below:
